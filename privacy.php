				<h4>
					Your privacy is an important factor that us considers in the development of each of our products and services. We are committed to being transparent and open. This Privacy Policy explains generally how we receive information about you, and what we do with that information once we have it.
				</h4>
				<h4>What do we mean by "personal information?"</h4>
				<p>
					For us, "personal information" means information which identifies you, like your name or email address.
				</p>
				<p>Any information that falls outside of this is "non-personal information."</p>
				<p>
					If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information. If we remove all personal information from a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information.
				</p>
				<h4>How do we store and protect your personal information?</h4>
				<p>
					We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it. We implement physical, business and technical security measures. Despite our efforts, if we learn of a security breach, we'll notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also don't want your personal information for any longer than we need it, so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for. Once we don't need it, we take steps to destroy it unless we are required by law to keep it longer.
